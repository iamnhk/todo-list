# todo-list
Assignment
Create a todo list app in plain Vanilla JavaScript

Use for example these JS topics: DOM manipulation with selectors (e.g. querySelector, querySelectorAll), addEventListener, innerHTML, classList, append, and other basic JavaScript topics e.g. array, store elements using variables (e.g. const, let), strings, etc

Note: We will also learn in upcoming lesson one topic which might be useful for you e.g. localStorage if you want to store the data in browser. It is optional for this task to use localStorage.
